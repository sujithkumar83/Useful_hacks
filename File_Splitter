#Method 2

Open a new Text document. Copy and paste the following:

@echo off

setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION

REM Edit this value to change the name of the file that needs splitting. Include the extension.

SET BFN=rte.csv

REM Edit this value to change the number of lines per file.

SET LPF=2500

REM Edit this value to change the name of each short file. It will be followed by a number indicating where it is in the list.

SET SFN=rtesplit

REM Do not change beyond this line.

SET SFX=%BFN:~-3%

SET /A LineNum=0

SET /A FileNum=1

For /F "delims==" %%l in (%BFN%) Do (

SET /A LineNum+=1

echo %%l >> %SFN%!FileNum!.%SFX%

if !LineNum! EQU !LPF! (

SET /A LineNum=0

SET /A FileNum+=1

)

)

endlocal

Pause

Here is what the configurations mean for the batch file before running. 

“SET BFN=” should point to the CSV you need to break down
“SET LPF=” is the number of rows you’d like to limit your new file to
“SET SFN=” is the new naming scheme for your split files

Save the file with a .BAT extn, and press OK when if a warning appears.
